# 👋 Hi there, I'm Peter!

Lead Quant Dev @ Inference Investment Management (London)  
40+ years of building software, breaking software, and occasionally fixing it again.  
Currently designing IT architecture, implementing AI tools, and still wondering why coffee isn’t tax deductible as R&D.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🇸🇪 Born and raised in Sweden, wandered through Switzerland, and now back in Sandviken.  
- 💻 C, C++, Java, Ruby, Python – if it compiles (or interprets), I’ve probably used it.  
- 🏦 Special focus on **derivatives, market making, hedge funds, and systematic trading**.  
- 🛠 Linux is home, Bash is my hammer, and sometimes everything looks like a nail.  

---

## 🧰 Tech Toolbox
- **Languages:** C/C++, Python, Java, Ruby  
- **Databases:** MySQL (SQLAlchemy + PyMySQL)  
- **Trading Platforms:** Interactive Brokers (IBAPI, ib_async, custom ZMQ pipelines)  
- **OS & Tools:** Linux (Ubuntu, Mint), Git, VS Code, Emacs (rookie), Bash  
- **Infra:** Flask, Nginx, Gunicorn, Kafka, OpenVPN

## 📈 Current Focus
- Building systematic multi-strategy trading systems (Credit, FX, Equities)  
- Data pipelines for tick & bar aggregation  
- Fun experiments with regime detection & signal generators  
- Making my \`.bashrc\` *slightly* less messy (spoiler: failing)

## ✨ Fun Facts
- I’ve been coding since before Stack Overflow existed (yes, people really debugged without it).  
- My servers are named after fantasy realms: *shire*, *rivendel*, *gondor*… guess the theme?  
- Still on the eternal quest for the perfect editor (spoiler: it doesn’t exist).
